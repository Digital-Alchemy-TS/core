## Whole Repo

### Boilerplate
#### Feature Flags

Control library features with flags passed to the bootstrapper. Some things are being defined as configuration items that are better set as flags

#### Bootstrap

- Library depends delcarations
- Optimize loading order for services & libs
#### Scheduler

- feature: sliding intervals, run x ms after previous execution finishes
- feature: #bottleneck wrapper
- feature: timeouts
	- primarily intended for early bootstrapping timeouts. kick off the timer with this, and it will `timeout` after bootstrapping finishes
		- primarily intended for debugging purposes, when you want to get easy to find logs. This helps ensure all the bootstrapping spam is done before kicking off the timer
		- also useful for any timeouts you want generic measurement metrics on
- feature: `Date` / #dayjs mode

## New Libraries
