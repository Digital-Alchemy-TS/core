## Introduction

The Digital Alchemy core utilities are a set of dependency-light tools for building backend applications with **TypeScript**. It targets the latest **ESModule** syntax and language standards, and it's compatible with Bun, Deno, and modern versions of NodeJS.

Modules leverage advanced TypeScript features to easily combine services and configurations into type-safe applications. This makes it friendly to a variety of use cases, from complex functional programming logic to usage as a smaller utility in an existing codebase.

The framework adds minimal overhead to boot times, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications, such as web servers, serverless functions, automation tools, and long-running background scripts.
## What it does

- **Service wiring** - Automatic dependency injection with full type safety
- **Configuration** - Load config from files, environment variables, CLI args
- **Logging** - Structured logging with customizable outputs
- **Lifecycle hooks** - Run code during app startup/shutdown
- **Task scheduling** - Cron jobs and timers
- **Testing utilities** - Mock and test your services easily
