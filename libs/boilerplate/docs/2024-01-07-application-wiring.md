# ZCC Library Architecture Design Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture and design for the ZCC library, a TypeScript-based framework tailored for applications such as home automation. The focus is on creating an intuitive, modern, and adaptable system, with an emphasis on clarity and usability for developers who may be new to TypeScript.

## Core Components and Workflow

### Library/Application Creation

- **`ServiceInitializer`**: A key component responsible for initializing services within the library/application. This function plays a crucial role in setting up and configuring services.
- **Library/Application Instances**: Instances of libraries and applications are denoted as `LibraryInstance` and `ApplicationInstance`, respectively. These instances are central to the operation and management of the library and applications built with it.

### Lifecycle Management

- **Lifecycle Phases**: The ZCC library lifecycle consists of several distinct phases:
  - **Construction Phase**: The initial phase where foundational setups are made.
  - **`onPreInit`**: Preparation before the initialization begins.
  - **`onPostConfig`**: Configurations are loaded and set.
  - **`onBootstrap`**: The system is fully configured and operational.
  - **`onReady`**: The system is ready to execute application-specific logic.
  - **`onShutdownStart`**: Commencement of the shutdown process.
  - **`onShutdownComplete`**: Completion of the shutdown process.

### Service and Functionality

- **Services**: Services are the functionalities or features provided by the library or application. They are central to the functionality of the ZCC library.
- **Service Methods**: The methods within a service, referred to as `ServiceActions` or `ServiceOperations`, are the operational functions that execute the service's specific tasks.

### Other Key Components

- **Configuration**: The configuration settings or object, crucial for the customization and setup of the library and applications.
- **Fetch Utility**: An instance of a fetch utility, used for network requests and data retrieval.
- **Lifecycle Management**: A utility for managing the different phases of the application or library lifecycle.
- **Logging**: The logger (`logger`) is used for logging and debugging purposes.

## Design Considerations

### Clarity and Simplicity

- The design focuses on clarity and simplicity, especially for developers new to TypeScript or programming. This is achieved through intuitive naming, straightforward workflows, and comprehensive documentation.

### Flexibility and Modularity

- The library is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing developers to easily add, modify, or remove services as needed.

### Error Handling and Debugging

- Clear and helpful error messages are crucial. The system should inform the developer of misuses, especially in critical areas like service initialization and lifecycle management.

### Documentation and Examples

- Comprehensive documentation, including clear examples and best practices, will be essential. This should guide users through the setup, usage, and customization of the library.

### Future-Proofing and Expandability

- While maintaining simplicity, the architecture should allow for future expansion and more advanced use cases, ensuring the library's long-term viability and adaptability.

## Conclusion

The ZCC library aims to provide a robust yet user-friendly framework for building various applications, with a particular emphasis on home automation systems. The architecture emphasizes intuitive design, clear lifecycle management, and ease of use, catering to both novice and experienced developers.
