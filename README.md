- **@zoe-codez/zcc/hass:** Facilitates base interactions with Home Assistant, including websocket connection management, entity reference checking, and a service call interface.

- **@zoe-codez/zcc/synapse:** Enables the generation of new entities in Home Assistant, such as buttons, sensors, and switches. Requires a socket connection and a custom component installation.

- **@zoe-codez/zcc/automation:** Focuses on home automation logic, offering room-based scene coordination, active state management for switches, circadian lighting, and more.

- **type-writer (CLI Tool):** A helper script that customizes internal type definitions by connecting to your Home Assistant instance and generating accurate service & entity validations.
