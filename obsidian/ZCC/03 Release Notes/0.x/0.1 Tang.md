## Goals Overview

This document outlines the high-level goals for developing a new home automation framework. Our primary objective is to achieve feature parity with existing home automation functionalities as seen in [[Digital Alchemy]]. This endeavor involves building a new framework from the ground up, emphasizing esmodule support and an integrated approach to application development, both in grammar and workflow.

### Development Steps:

1. **New Wiring Mechanism:** Establish a robust and flexible wiring mechanism tailored for our framework.
2. **Testing Hooks:** Implement comprehensive testing hooks to ensure functionality and reliability.
3. **Boilerplate Library:** Develop a new boilerplate library that serves as the foundation for our framework.

### Key Library Components:

- **Home-Assistant Integration:** #zcc-home-assistant
  - Focus on API-level interactions.
  - Incorporate #type-writer functionality for enhanced control.

- **HA Virtual Entity Bridge:** #zcc-virtual-entity-bridge
  - Implement the #push-entity concept, derived from [[home-assistant|@digital-alchemy/home-assistant]]

- **Automation Logic:** #zcc-automation-logic
  - Port home automation-focused workflows from [[automation-logic|@digital-alchemy/automation-logic]]
  - Ensure seamless integration with the new framework.

- **MQTT Wrapper:**
  - Develop a basic MQTT wrapper to facilitate communication within the automation logic.

- **Gotify:**
  - Create a straightforward fetch wrapper library, ensuring an easy porting process.

-  [ ] :SiJest: tests
-  [ ] :SiBaremetrics: metrics
-  [x] basic functionality port

### MQTT

- #zcc-mqtt

MQTT bindings for other libraries to take advantage of. Mostly exists for the purpose of configuring the library

-  [ ]  :SiBaremetrics: metrics
-  [x] basic functionality port

### Automation Logic

- #zcc-automation-logic

Another feature port, building on top of #zcc-home-assistant, #zcc-ha-virtual-entity-bridge, and #zcc-server libraries. I
