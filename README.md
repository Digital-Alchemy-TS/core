# Digital Alchemy core üåü

## Introduction

`@digital-alchemy`: A TypeScript framework designed for Home Assistant, enabling dynamic entity management, service calls, and automation with minimal dependencies.

## üì¶ Major Exports

`@digital-alchemy` framework is built on key exports, each offering unique features that complement one another:

- **@digital-alchemy/core (Base Framework):** Provides caching, logging, configuration, lifecycle events, and utility types.

- **@digital-alchemy/core/hass:** Facilitates base interactions with Home Assistant, including websocket connection management, entity reference checking, and a service call interface.

- **@digital-alchemy/core/synapse:** Enables the generation of new entities in Home Assistant, such as buttons, sensors, and switches. Requires a socket connection and a custom component installation.

- **@digital-alchemy/core/automation:** Focuses on home automation logic, offering room-based scene coordination, active state management for switches, circadian lighting, and more.

- **type-writer (CLI Tool):** A helper script that customizes internal type definitions by connecting to your Home Assistant instance and generating accurate service & entity validations.
