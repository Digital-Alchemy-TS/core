# Utilities Library README

## Overview

This Utilities Library is a compact yet versatile toolkit designed for various utility functions and helpers in JavaScript programming. It's a foundational library, ensuring other parts of your project can depend on it without internal dependencies.

## Library Features

1. **Named Constants**: Provides a range of constants for common operations and values.
2. **Helper Functions**: Includes a set of small, reusable functions to simplify common coding tasks.
3. **`is` Object**: A collection of type testing and basic conversion tools, useful for validating and manipulating data types.
4. **`ZCC` Object**: Implements an EventEmitter for event-driven programming, which is augmented in other parts of the repo to provide additional functionality.

## Augmentation

### Augmenting `ZCC`

Augmentation Examples
Augmenting ZCC

To augment the ZCC object, you can add new properties or methods that extend its functionality. Below is an example of augmenting ZCC with a new method for handling custom events.

```typescript
import { ZCC } from "@zcc/utilities";

function createFeatureTracker() {
  const features = new Map();

  return {
    enableFeature: (featureName) => {
      features.set(featureName, true);
    },
    disableFeature: (featureName) => {
      features.set(featureName, false);
    },
    isFeatureEnabled: (featureName) => {
      return features.get(featureName) || false;
    },
  };
}

declare module "@zcc/utilities" {
  export interface ZCCDefinition {
    featureTracker: ReturnType<typeof createFeatureTracker>;
  }
}

// Adding featureTracker to ZCC
ZCC.featureTracker = createFeatureTracker();
```

## Augmenting `is`

Similarly, augmenting the is object allows adding new type-checking functions or other utilities. Here's an example:

```typescript
declare module "@zcc/utilities" {
  export interface IS_Definition {
    isColor: (value: unknown) => boolean;
  }
}

is.isColor = function(value) {
  const colorRegex = /^#(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{3}){1,2}$/;
  return typeof value === 'string' && colorRegex.test(value);
};
```

## Exported Functions: sleep

The `sleep` function in the Utilities Library is a powerful and flexible tool designed for asynchronous operations. It serves to delay code execution for a specified duration or until a certain time. What makes this function stand out is its capability for early termination through a 'kill' method, providing greater control over asynchronous delays.

### Sleep Features

- **Duration-based Delay**: Allows setting a sleep duration in milliseconds.
- **Time-specific Delay**: Enables setting a sleep until a specific future Date object.
- **Early Termination**: Offers a 'kill' method to stop the sleep immediately.

### Usage Examples

1. **Basic Sleep for a Duration**:

```typescript
// Sleeps for 5 seconds
await sleep(5000);
```

2. Sleep Until a Specific Time:

```typescript
// Set a wake-up time for 7 AM, January 3, 3024
const wakeUpTime = new Date('3024-01-03T07:00:00');
// Sleeps until the specified wake-up time
await sleep(wakeUpTime);
```

3. Early Termination of Sleep:

```typescript
// Initiates a sleep for 10 seconds
const timer = sleep(10 * SECOND);
// Sets a condition to kill the sleep after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => timer.kill("continue"), 3 * SECOND);
// Sleeps for only 3 seconds, as it's killed early
await timer;
```

### CronExpression

The CronExpression enum in the library provides a diverse set of predefined cron schedule patterns, simplifying the setup of routine tasks. These expressions cover a wide range of frequencies, from seconds to yearly schedules.

Summary of Cron Patterns:

- **Seconds**: Schedules for every second, every 5, 10, and 30 seconds.
- **Minutes**: Configurations for every minute, as well as every 5, 10, and 30 minutes.
- **Hourly**: Options for every hour, and every 2, 3, 4, ..., up to every 12 hours.
- **Daily**: Patterns for every day at specific hours, from 1 AM to 11 PM, including midnight.
- **Weekly**: Schedules for every week, weekdays, and weekends.
- **Monthly**: Monthly triggers, including every 1st day of the month at midnight and noon, and every 2nd month.
- **Quarterly and Biannually**: Options for every quarter and every 6 months.
- **Yearly**: Annual schedule.
- **Special Ranges**: For example, every 30 minutes between 9 AM and 5 PM, and specific schedules for weekdays at every hour.

This enumeration facilitates the easy setup of recurring tasks without the need to manually write complex cron expressions, making it a valuable asset for scheduling in various applications.
