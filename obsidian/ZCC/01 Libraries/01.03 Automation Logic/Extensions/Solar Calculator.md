## Known issues

- #FIXME

There's probably some event that home assistant emits when lat/long updates. This isn't currently tied in, and it seems like an extreme edge case. Probably not a lot of work though

## Enhancements

### Configurations

This could also take in lat/long via config. Might not be a big enough problem though

### Math
